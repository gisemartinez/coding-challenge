Make sure to use a private github repository to develop your solution and share it with us either via a zip or by inviting us as collaborators. 

# Implementation notes: 

- Can't change the privacy of a fork so I will delete after meeting

- Didn't spend much time on analysing concurrency but I envision to talk that out on the assignment debrief. 
- Used Sangria and Cats-effect, besides Slick. 
- Commit history is intentionally made so review is easier
- Latest version of this branch has been uploaded to my personal dockerhub, so the app should work with the usual 
`docker-compose up --build`
